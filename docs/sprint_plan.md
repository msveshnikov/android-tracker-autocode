Based on the current product backlog and project state, here's a proposed sprint plan:

# Sprint Plan

## Sprint Goal
Implement core functionality for step tracking and improve the app's user interface to create a functional and visually appealing MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

## Selected User Stories/Tasks (Prioritized)

1. Persist steps to database
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - Priority: High

2. Improve UI design
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - Priority: High

3. Add charts for daily, weekly, and monthly step data
   - Estimated effort: 13 story points
   - Priority: High

4. Implement calorie calculation
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - Priority: Medium

5. Create settings screen for user information
   - Estimated effort: 5 story points
   - Priority: Medium

6. Implement automatic step counting
   - Estimated effort: 8 story points
   - Priority: High

7. Add privacy-focused features
   - Estimated effort: 3 story points
   - Priority: Medium

## Dependencies and Risks

1. Persisting steps to database:
   - Dependency: None
   - Risk: Potential performance issues with large datasets

2. Improve UI design:
   - Dependency: None
   - Risk: Design approval may cause delays

3. Add charts:
   - Dependency: Persisting steps to database
   - Risk: Chart library integration might be complex

4. Implement calorie calculation:
   - Dependency: Create settings screen for user information
   - Risk: Accuracy of calorie calculations without personalized data

5. Create settings screen:
   - Dependency: None
   - Risk: None significant

6. Implement automatic step counting:
   - Dependency: None
   - Risk: Battery drain issues, accuracy on various devices

7. Add privacy-focused features:
   - Dependency: Persisting steps to database
   - Risk: None significant

## Definition of Done

For this sprint, a task is considered done when:

1. Code is written and adheres to the project's coding standards
2. Unit tests are written and passing
3. Feature has been tested on at least two different Android devices
4. UI components are responsive and follow the agreed design guidelines
5. Code has been reviewed and approved by at least one other team member
6. Feature is functional and integrated with the main branch without conflicts
7. Basic user documentation for the feature has been written
8. Any known bugs are documented and prioritized for future sprints

Additionally, for the sprint to be considered successful:
- All high-priority items (1, 2, 3, and 6) must be completed
- At least one medium-priority item should be completed
- The app should be in a state where it can track steps, display basic statistics, and have an improved UI
